# Backend Project Name

Welcome to the backend of my project! Please note that this is a bare-bones implementation and some features may not be fully functional yet.

## Project Description

This project is built using Node.js and Express, and it serves as the backend for my application. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data. Currently, the migrations are not connected to the project, but they reflect the structure and initial state of the database. If you would like to match the database state, you can manually execute the SQL statements found in the migrations folder.

## Getting Started

To start the backend server, navigate to the project directory and run:
`node server.js`

This will start the server on the specified port (default is 3001). Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine before running the command.
